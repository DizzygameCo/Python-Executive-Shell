PythonOS:

This is a project I made as an operating system parody, that has simple functions like telling the time, or writing to text files.
It's not really a real operating system since it isn't run on a computer naitively and does not interact with hardware, so not a real kernel at all.

How to use:

Opening the file requires the macOS version of Python 3.9 (Since I don't know if it works the same on Windows or Linux.)

To open the file right click and open with Python. This will take you inside the code. Use F5 or fn + F5 to run the program. 
Use /help for commands that are used in the faux operating system.
